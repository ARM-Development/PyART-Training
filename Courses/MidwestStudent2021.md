# the 2021 Midwest Student Conference on Atmospheric Research

The Python ARM Radar Toolkit is a open source community platform for interacting with radar (and even LIDAR) data based
around a common data model. Py-ART is supported by the United States Department of Energy, Office of Science, 
[ARM program](www.arm.gov) and we are grateful for their support. 

Py-ART is a [community codebase with 38 contributors](https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart)!  

The Py-ART component will cover three notebooks from our training repository. This will be mainly done in a
 demonstration mode with some time for exploring.
 
 The three notebooks are:
 1) [Reading data using Py-ART and a basic explore of the data model and plotting.](../1-Introduction/1_pyart_reading_and_plotting_data.ipynb)
 2) [Mapping polar radar data onto a cartesian grid and a bit more Cartopy fun](../1-Introduction/2_Introduction_to_gridding.ipynb)
 3) [An Application of Py-ART to NEXRAD in the Cloud and linking to MetPy](../2-Cloud_Examples/1-NEXRAD_on_Amazon.ipynb)
